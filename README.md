# Curiosity
FA21 CS/ECE 598 Learning-Based Robotics github repo

The project is to use intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) from Pathak et al. (2017) with DQN instead of policy iteration to solve the sparse reward problem. We stress test on super mario bros, mountaincar-v0, and lunarlander-v2 and showed the importance of intrinsic reward from ICM when the agent is facing with the sparse reward environments. A small part of the code borrowed from MP2 for this course and [mario pytorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/mario_rl_tutorial.html).
